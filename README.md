- 👋 Hi, I’m [@ItsLychee](github.com/ItsLychee)
- 💞 I’m interested in Golang, Rust, Python, and things of networking
- ☑️ I have 3+ years experience in programming!

Hey there! As you already know, I'm Lychee! I am currently working on learning golang and once i feel fairly confident
in my skills I'll start publicizing some projects, ranging to personal to general.


I think that's it!
